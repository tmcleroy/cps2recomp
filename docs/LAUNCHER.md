# The launcher

## Its pages

![The launcher's Games page](screenshots/launcher-games.png)

Each game you have a ROM set for gets a page of its own in the sidebar: its Display switches (full screen,
widescreen), Play, and the features only it has. The **Features** page has what the games share (free play,
cheats, run-ahead, the picture, training mode's displays and the dummy, and the rest), set for every game at
once; a feature changed in a game's own menu is set for the others too when you leave the game. The
**Controllers** page sets the keys and buttons for all of them; its Layout for chooses a game, and Its own layout
gives that game keys and buttons apart from the others', under the game's own names for its buttons.

A release that ships its sets beside the launcher — a `roms` folder of zips — has them found when it opens: each
game whose set is there has it chosen for it, after the game's own check of it, and nothing is moved. A zip that is
named for no game is found by the files in it.

The games are in your order: drag a game's row in the sidebar up or down to keep the ones you play most at the top
(with a gamepad or the keyboard, **Move up** and **Move down** on its page, under Play). The Games page lists them
the same way. Playing only one or two of the games? Switch on **Only the games you have** on the Games page, and the
others are left out of it and of the Features and Controllers pages (**Choose folder…** still finds them). On a small screen, or with large text, the launcher closes up to fit: a narrower sidebar whose list
scrolls, and each row's buttons under its words.

## Updates

When the launcher opens it asks GitHub for this project's releases (the Updates card, at the top of the Games
page, has a switch to stop that, and **Check now**). When there is a newer version it shows at the top of the Games page: **What's new**
opens its notes, and **Update** downloads the new version's download for your system (the same file as on the
releases page), checks it and every file that changed against the release's list, and only then
puts them all in place; if anything goes wrong nothing is changed. The launcher then starts again as the new
version. Your settings, save states and ROM sets are not touched. Quit the games first: Update waits until none is
running. A beta is offered only to a beta.

The launcher needs to be able to write to its own folder: on macOS, move `CPS-2 Recomp.app` to Applications (or
anywhere of your own) before opening it the first time, not run it from the downloaded zip's folder. A copy built
from source is told of a new version but not changed.

## Portable mode

To keep everything with the launcher (on a USB stick or an external drive you take from one computer to another),
put an empty file named `portable.txt` beside it:

| System | Where `portable.txt` goes | Where your things then are |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows, Linux, Steam Deck | in the `CPS2Recomp` folder, beside `cps2recomp-launcher` | `CPS2Recomp/user/` |
| macOS | in the folder `CPS-2 Recomp.app` is in (not inside the app) | `user/` in that folder |

Settings, save states, each board's settings memory, custom colours, the score attack records, a soundtrack in
the game's own folder and the logs then go in `user/`, a folder for the launcher and one for each game, laid out
as in your user folder. The launcher's Games page shows where they are under **Your files** (**Show** opens the
folder).

- **The first time**, if your user folder already has the games' things, the launcher asks whether to copy them
  to `user/`. Copying never takes anything from your user folder and never writes over a file.
- **To stop**, take `portable.txt` away: the launcher uses your user folder again, as it was when you started
  portable mode. Nothing is moved either way; to carry things back, copy the folders in `user/` to your user
  folder yourself (with the launcher closed).
- **Updates** keep `portable.txt` and `user/`: they change only the release's own files.
- **The folder has to be one you can write to.** If it is not (a read-only drive, or Windows' Program Files), the
  launcher says so and stops rather than keep your things somewhere else.
- ROM sets are still only read, wherever they are. A ROM folder chosen on a drive letter (Windows) or a mount
  point (`/Volumes/...`, `/media/...`) is remembered as that path: on another computer, choose it again if the
  drive is somewhere else. A Steam shortcut (**Add to Steam**) is for the computer it was added on.

## From a terminal

```sh
cps2recomp-launcher --play sfa2                 # straight into a game, as the launcher has it set
cps2recomp-launcher --play sfa2 -- --features widescreen,no_damage
                                                # with more arguments for the game, after the launcher's own
cps2recomp-launcher --page vampire_savior       # the launcher, at a game's page
sfa2 --rom ~/roms/sfa2u.zip --settings my.ini   # a game's own program (beside the launcher), by itself
sfa2 --soundtrack ~/music/sfa2-arranged          # a custom soundtrack's folder (with the feature on)
sfa2 --help                                     # what a game's program takes
```

The games' ids are `ssf2t`, `sfa`, `sfa2`, `sfz2al`, `sfa3`, `pocket_fighter`, `msh`, `xmvsf`, `mshvsf`, `mvsc`, `puzzle_fighter`, `dstlk`, `nwarr`, `vampire_savior`, `vsav2`, `vhunt2`, `vsav_definitive`, `avsp`, `dino`, `punisher`, `sf2ce`, `sf2hf` and `ghouls`. `--features` may be given more than once, and
a later one wins.

## Coming from a game's own download

Earlier releases came one game at a time (Street Fighter Alpha 2 Recomp, Vampire Savior Recomp). This launcher
keeps each game's settings, save states and board memory in the same folder as before, and takes the ROM set you
chose in a game's own launcher, so everything carries on. A game's own release still works.
