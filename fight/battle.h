//   Survival        the player against one opponent after another, with the health left from the fight
//                   before; over at the first knock-down, with the count of opponents beaten.
//   Endless battle  two fighters the game plays, with no panel; the one knocked down is replaced. A person
//                   takes a fighter over by touching the controls, and gives it back by leaving them alone.
//                   Started by the launcher's Multi game page (--multi endless:shuffle:SECONDS or
//                   endless:scroll:SPEED; runtime/game.h, MultiGame), it is begun at once and shows every stage
//                   once (shuffled and faded into one another, or scrolling by in order), then fades out and ends
//                   the program with kNextGame, for the next game's turn.
//   Ring out        the player against one opponent after another, with no health: a stage's ends are open,
//                   and whoever is knocked over one is thrown out and falls through the floor. The winner jumps
//                   off, and the camera follows it down onto the next stage.
//   Team battle     two teams of two or three, chosen on the menu: one fighter of each side at a time, the one
//                   knocked down out and the next of that side in, with full health; the winner stays on with
//                   the health it has left. Over when a side has nobody left. Side 2 is a person or the game; with
//                   the tag-team modes (tag.h) each fighter of a side may be a person of its own. Its tag style
//                   (a game that can swap a fighter mid-fight): each fighter has a bar of its own, Tag (a gamepad's left trigger) or Start tags
//                   the next one in whenever the fighter on can act, and a bar emptied brings the next in.
//
// A game's sources describe where the game keeps what these need (Description) and register it; they also
// make the ring out's own movements of a player at its step of a fight (RingOutMove) and let a player knocked
// about go over a stage's end (RingOutLetsOut), where the game keeps the players in.
