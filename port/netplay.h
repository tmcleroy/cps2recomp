// Online play (issue #70): two copies of the game, one on each player's machine, each running the whole game with
// both players' controls. Each side sends the other its own player's controls, frame by frame, over UDP. A frame
// does not wait for the other side's: until they come they are guessed (as they last were), and when they come and
// a guess was wrong, the game is put back to that frame and the frames since are run again with the real ones
// (rollback, as --rollback-test tries it: port.h, RollbackTest). Neither side is ahead of the other's controls by
// more than kMostAhead frames: past that, it waits.
//
// --host [PORT] waits for the other player; --join ADDRESS[:PORT] goes to them. The host is player 1. Before the
// first frame the two make sure they are the same game, and the joining side takes the host's board settings
// (the settings memory) and the features that change play (Game and Board, and widescreen); the cheats and the rest of
// the alternative modes, training, run-ahead and the like stay off. Every so often each sends the other a hash of
// the game as it was at a frame both have the real controls for; if the two differ, the games have come apart
// (a desync), and the match stops, saying so.
