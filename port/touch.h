// Controls on a touch screen (a phone): a stick at the left, the game's buttons at the right (six, or the game's
// own: game.cfg's buttons), and Coin, Start, the menu and (where the game zooms) the zoom at the top; player 1's,
// beside a gamepad's and the keys.
// They go where the window has room beside the picture (a phone's screen is wider than it), over its edges where
// it has not. They are shown on Android until a gamepad or a key is used, and anywhere once the screen is touched.
// With no finger on the screen for five seconds they are no longer drawn (the picture whole again); a touch brings
// them back, and is a press of what is under it, as when they are drawn.
// In the menu the stick moves through it and the first two buttons choose and go back.
