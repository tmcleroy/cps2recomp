// The camera's zoom: the picture shown larger about one player's fighter, following it, at the sizes the model
// viewer draws a character at from its own to twice it (twice: the top of a tall one goes off the screen). A
// press for a player steps its size up, from 2x back to none; a press for the other player looks at that one
// instead, at the same size. The fighter is always in the middle (past the picture's edges is black); the size,
// and the place looked at when it changes fighter, go smoothly from one to the next, and what was
// chosen is said on the picture for a few seconds. Only where the game's sources say where a fighter is
// (runtime/game.h, Game::focus), and only while there is one: elsewhere the picture goes back to its own size.
// It is the window's alone: the game, its save states and its screenshots know nothing of it.
//
// Or both fighters at once: the camera is as close as keeps both in the picture (2x at most, the whole picture at
// least), between them, and inside the picture's edges: tight when they are close, wide when they are apart.
