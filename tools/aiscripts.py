Alpha 1's, 2's and 3's computer is an interpreter running scripts from the ROM, a set for each character
(games/vampire_savior/PROGRESS.md, "The computer player"; games/sfa/PROGRESS.md, games/sfa2/PROGRESS.md and

Read from a build's work/<id>/ (program.lst, program.bin, program.bin.data), run from the repository's top.

                                          every step from one to the next one the scripts allow
                                          (CPS2RECOMP_WATCH_REPORTS=N for more than the first 2,000 writes)

The instructions' lengths are the game's own: its routine that skips over instructions (an "if" whose test
fails) has a table of them, read here from the program. The instructions are named by the interpreter they
were read from, told apart by where it keeps the computer's part of a player's record: Vampire Savior's (the
banks' places from +210) or Alpha 2's (from +220, its record's fields 10h on from Vampire Savior's; fewer
operations, a second "if" with "else if" and a break out of it, the Alpha counter); Alpha 3's is Alpha 2's with its
own fields and more (the isms, a throw, a custom combo), named by the game, and so is Alpha 1's, Alpha 2's with less
(one "if", fewer waits and tests). An instruction of another kind is printed as its words.

Each character has four banks of scripts: 0 its plans (one chosen by the game), 1 its tactics (one at random
from 32 slots for its plan, in the row of its tier: 0, 20 or 40 by the difficulty), 2 its reactions to an attack or a
projectile (likewise at random), 3 more reactions (one chosen by the game). A script is a word (what happens
when it is broken off) and instructions, two bytes each (an operation and a kind of it) and words after, to
the end (FF). Distances are the gap between the two fighters (Vampire Savior +130, Alpha 2 +218). A move is a
word, bit 0 clear for a normal and set for a special. Vampire Savior's: a normal's stance, punch or kick,
strength, the directions held and a variant, or a special's number and strength. Alpha 2's: three bits held
for a character's command normals (+212, +213, +214), then a normal's stance, punch or kick and strength, a
nibble each, or a special's number, punch or kick and strength.
