# Online play (issue #70, port/netplay.h) between two copies of the game on this machine: one hosts, the other
# joins it over localhost, each with made-up play for its own player, every packet sent late (50 ms, give or take 25)
# and one in twenty lost (--net-fake), so that the guesses go wrong and frames are rolled back. The host has every
# feature that changes play on and the joining side none, so the joining side must take the host's (and both turn
# off the cheats). Both write a
# frame's state hash once it has both players' real controls (--hash-log); the two logs must be the same, and
# neither side may stop on a desync. And the host's record of both players' controls (--record), replayed without the
# network, must give the same hashes: each player's controls drove their own player. At the board's pace: FRAMES
# (3000 unless said) take FRAMES / 60 seconds.
#
# JOIN_ROM: the joining side's set, another region's (game.cfg's other_set): it plays the host's program, whose online_words
# the host sends, so the two logs and the replay (of the host's set) must still be the same.
#
# ARCADE=1: the host plays alone while it waits (--net-arcade) and the other side joins a few seconds later, so that
# the match begins from the game as the host's play left it, sent whole; the replay from the board's reset is not tried.
# TEST_MENU=1: the host holds the test switch at frames 180:240, and the joining player tries it at 300:360.
# Only the host's switch may appear in the recorded controls; the replay also verifies its effect on the board.
