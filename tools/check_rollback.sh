# What online play's rollback needs of a game (issue #70): that a frame put back and run again comes out exactly as
# the first time. Made-up play for as many players as the game has (game.cfg's players; two unless said) is run straight, and again with
# --rollback-test (port/port.h, RollbackTest: player 2's controls late and guessed, and the frames guessed wrong
# run again); the per-frame state hashes must be the same. Three ways:
#   1. with the game's own features;
#   2. with every feature that changes play switched on (the cheats, free play, widescreen, the arcade timing...);
#   3. as 2, but the frames run again not drawn (--hash-no-picture: all but the picture compared), as online play
#      runs them.
# A difference is something the game keeps outside its save state, or that a frame run twice does twice.
#
# FEATURES: more features for every run, a mode to try (FEATURES=tag_team=2,cross_fever: Marvel vs. Capcom's four people,
# in Cross Fever).
